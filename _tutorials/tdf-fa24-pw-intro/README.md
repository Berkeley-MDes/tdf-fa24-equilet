# Introductory Particle Workbench Worked Examples

Instructions on how to make a new project that can utilize these files are located [here](https://github.com/Berkeley-MDes/24f-desinv-202/wiki/Particle-Workbench)

Please try each file in a new project you create (copy/paste the contents of the files) and see how they differ.  
You can compile and flash between files as many times as you like.  If you are interested in the completed file sets, I can distribute this in class during the next session.

Note that we are essentially building up one example over time, eventually arriving at a functional demo prototype that 
    - takes input from a button, 
    - processes it on the device, 
    - outputs signals via the digital pins of the microcontroller, 
    - and publishes resultant data to the cloud.

The button event from your finger-press
    - alters the periodicity of the `loop()` function that is running
    - calls a custom interrupt function, which then
    - alters the state of what is detected in the `loop()`
    - once this occurs, the rate of the `loop()`'s evaluation is updated

Each time the `loop()` runs, 
    - a counter is incremented
    - the increment updates the count variable
    - a new character is chosen based on this variable
    
Each time the count reaches the end of "Hello World!"
    - a secondary counter is incremented
    - the first counter is reset to 0
    - an LED flashes for a period of time
    - an event is published to the cloud with the value of the counter

This last part is where we end, in `06_publishing_info.cpp`.
We build up to this point in 6 stages, and each stage can be evaluted in a separate file.

You can view the result of the call to `Particle.publish()` by going [here](https://console.particle.io/devices) in a Chrome Browser.
    - click on your device
    - view the area labeled `Events` for new events generated by the device
